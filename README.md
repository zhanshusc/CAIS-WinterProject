Using the computer vision model mobile net pretrained on the dataset imagenet created a binary classification that distinguishes images of chihuahua from images of muffins

Dataset: The Kaggle dataset of chihuahuas and muffines, set to a standard 256 by 256 into batches of 32, I searched a little bit and these seemed like standard conditions being powers of 2.
Model Development and Training: 
I used a pretrained model that was quicker to run rather than one that was more robust and trained on imagenet which seems like the standard for working with images, this allowed for faster training but probably gave up some accuracies along the way. The top layer of the model is discarded since that is the connected last layer of the network, and the existing layers of the model are set to untrainable which maintains the mobilenet network as training happens to extend off of it rather than change it. and in its place I added the layers of global average pooling 2d which converts the 2d mapping of the image into a single 1D which is the flatten step at the end of a cnn as well as the sigmoid function which outputs it to a result. I chose not to add additional relu, convolution then pooling layers as they didn't seem to improve the end overall performance and instead just added a connections dropout layer since my results started to have slightly higher accuracy in training than testing and I found it helped with preventing overfitting by dropping 50% of nodes randomly. The optimizer and learning rates I went with adam and 0.0001 with binary cross entropy as the loss function seemed to work well enough where through epochs the gradient descent stabilizes at a minimum(hopefully not local) and has small fluctuations.   

Model Evaluation/Results:
The metrics I chose was accuracy since its downsides are often imbalances within the dataset, and with a relatively balanced dataset containing similar number of images for both, accuracy then becomes the easiest figure to visualize for the greatest number of people The end result was a 0.875 accuracy for the test set 

Discussion: 
Since the purpose of the task is to differentiate chihuahuas and muffins based on the meme the dataset is probably not the best option(and best as in options that may or may not exist right) since the memes have images where they share much more similar characteristics rather than scraped images where they appear more different from one another. But, overall I think everything fits pretty well to the task imagenet is supposed to provide images of commonplace objects and CNN seems like the standard procedure for the binary classification of images and everything else was adjusted based on that overall structure. Accuracy seems like a good metric but based on the meme so does every other metric cause if the algorithm performs well under any metric given a relatively balanced dataset it should mean it is able to distinguish chihuahuas from muffins. 
The efforts can be extended to wider implications that things sharing similar features can be distinguished by machine learning as well as using the backbone of pre trained models to achieve differentiations at a faster training rate this can all be applied to social good in some ways or another. The limitations that should be considered are that chihuahuas and muffins are usually not under the same context and their differentiation is a low risk scenario for a meme but if the stakes are higher for distinguishing objects than it needs to perform better in terms of accuracy.
If I were to continue this project, first steps are probably see if just using cnn without the pretrained model could lead to improvements since while imagenet contains chihuahuas it does not contain muffins and that can be seen with the program mostly getting wrong answers by labeling muffins chihuahuas and not vice versa, also using a more robust model like efficient net or VGG16 and taking longer to train can also help in the final scores most likely. There's probably more fine tuning that can be done as well looking at different additional layers and analyzing for impacts to make smaller adjustments could be beneficial as well.
